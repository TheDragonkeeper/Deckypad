# Deckypad
Primarily made for use with the Steam Deck to allow its gamepad to be used on another PC remotely over a network.
You can use any network interface, be it Wifi/Ethernet/Bluetooth  but if you use bluetooth it must be setup to have a IP address.

You need to have the requirement installed in the python enviroment:

### Decky-client.py is used for the client side (deck):
pip requirements:
- pygame

### Decky-host.py is used for the server side (windows/linux):
pip requirements:
-  vgamepad
-  mouse
-  keyboard
  
# Usage:
### Client
#### method 1 (xbox controller emulation only atm)
- run Decky-client.py in your preferred python enviroment that has the requirement
- Insert your Hosts IP and Port into the input boxes
- click Connect
#### method 2
- run Decky-client.py in your preferred python enviroment that has the requirement
- assign an argument to the script,  Deckypad-client.py <Host IP>:<Port Number>
  this can also be achieved in gamemode,
- example 1:
  ```
  python  Deckypad-client.py 192.168.1.100:9090
  ```
- example 2 you can also specify which controller you would like to use (for ds4 controller emulation):
  ```
  python  Deckypad-client.py 192.168.1.100:9090 ds4
  ```
  
### Host
##### Linux  may need sudo privileges in some cases.
#### method 1
- just run the script as
```
python Deckypad-host.py
```
- this runs on all interfaces and port 9090
#### method 2
- assign an interface and port using script arguments
```
python Deckypad-host.py <Port Number> <Host interface IP>
```


# What works:
- Network connection: client to server
- Gamepad detection and hotplugging
- Xbox360 Gamepad Emulation
- Mouse Emulation
- Keyboard Emulation (currently only standard keys and shift modifier)
- Playstation DS4 Gamepad Emulation
- Multiple Clients can connect to have different controllers usable for multiplayer games.

# TODO:
- Create Bluetooth setup and network
- Add option to blackout screen

# Known issues
- Mouse Emulation doesnt work in all games, Sometimes the window captures the mouse preventing it other programs from moving it.
